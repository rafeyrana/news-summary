# Tech News Daily: Automated News Scraping and Emailing Service

## Description
Tech News Daily is a Python-based project designed to automatically scrape the latest technology news from selected websites, summarize the articles for brevity, and then email these summaries to a list of subscribers. The project utilizes `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping and `transformers` (T5 model) for summarizing the articles. The email distribution is handled through SMTP using the `email.py` script.
